# Fuel Consumption Regression

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict fuel consumption based on various features. After testing several methods the one that gave the best results was polynomial regression with regularization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes cars technical data such as engine size, number of cylinders, fuel type, and more. It is sourced from [\[kaggle car dataset\]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahaidulislam/car-specification-dataset-1945-2020).
